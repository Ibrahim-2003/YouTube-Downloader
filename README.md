# YouTube Downloader
 
This program downloads YouTube videos either as MP4 videos or MP3 audio files. To download a video, replace the URL in the Python file, or create a file named `ytmp3links.txt`, paste the links in separated by line breaks, and adjust the filepath in the Python file if you want multiple videos.
